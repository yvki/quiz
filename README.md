# Project Background
One of my modules for Year 1 is **Fundamentals Of Programming (aka FOP)** where I had to **develop a prototype for a quiz application from scratch over 2 months** based on a given problem statement...

## Problem Statement

You are encouraged to design your own **text-based UI** as a teaching aid for students. The application will display 5 quiz questions one by one, allowing user to enter his/her answers and submit the quiz. It then display the results of the quiz. 

### Program Requirements

Using the **Object Oriented Programming (aka OOP)** concept learnt in the module, the application should consist of **2 classes**...

- **MCQ class to represent a question** and **by adding a constructor, it should have the variables to store the question, four choices, user's answer and the correct answer for the question**.

- **Quiz class that contains at least 15 MCQ questions (5 questions for each quiz category)**. It should have **an array that stores all 15 MCQ objects** and **another array to store the 5 MCQ objects from the selected category**. It should also include **a method to check whether all questions are answered** and **another method to calculate the final results**.

### Basic Features

- **3 quiz categories, each consisting of 5 MCQs** to choose from

- once the last question (ie. q5) is answered, the program should show the **answer summary page which shows all answers given by the user who is then allowed to submit the quiz or go back to retry any of the 5 questions**

-	Once the quiz is submitted, the **result summary screen will be displayed showing the quiz result and a congratulatory message if the user does well**

### Advance Features

- implementation of **more than 3 quiz categories** 

- use of **file system to store all questions and, or quiz result**

- option to view **answer sheet** if user did not score full marks on the quiz

### Project Setup

1. Download the zipped files and open them in ```Visual Studio Code```.

2. Click on `Run > Run without Debugging` and interact with the quiz in the terminal.
